 <h3>Hello, I'm matheusinit</h3>

 I'm Matheus Oliveira, a **Software Engineer**. I'm a 22 years old guy who likes to write tests with TDD. My main language is **Typescript/Javascript**, but I have experience in _Python_ and _Java_ as well. I am determined and focused, even more when I am programming. I'm always testing new technologies to improve my todays' perspective on projects. I'm enthusiastic to transmit knowledge and see others improving because of that. I believe technology can help people and I'm more than happy to participate with hard work.
 
Currently I'm learning about **Data Science**
